# Book a Doctor

Book a Doctor is a web application designed to simplify the process of booking doctor appointments online. This platform enables users to find doctors, schedule appointments, and manage healthcare needs efficiently. The app supports three types of users: **Patients**, **Doctors**, and **Admins**.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Secure authentication for patients, doctors, and admins using JWT.
- **Doctor Search & Appointment Booking**: Patients can search for doctors by specialty, location, and availability, then book appointments accordingly.
- **Appointment Management**: Patients can view, cancel, or reschedule their appointments, while doctors can confirm or modify appointments.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can review and approve new doctor registrations and oversee platform activities.
- **Real-Time Updates**: All users receive real-time updates on appointment statuses.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Material UI and Bootstrap for a modern, user-friendly interface across devices.

## Technical Architecture

The Book a Doctor application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js and styled using Material UI and Bootstrap.
- **Backend**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and server logic.
